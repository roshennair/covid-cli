# COVID-CLI - A COVID-19 CLI application made using Rust

This is a small project I made the day after attending a Rust workshop hosted by APU's Student Developer Society. Essentially, it is a tool that allows users to get the latest data on COVID-19 cases, deaths & recoveries on a global and local (country-based) scale.

## Commands:

- ```covid-cli global``` - Returns the global summary data
- ```covid-cli <country-slug>``` - Returnst the local summary data for a specific country*.

\* In order to get a full list of country slug codes for each country, visit https://api.covid19api.com/countries.
